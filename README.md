# Digital Nurture 4.0 â€“ Java FSE Week 6 Assignments (ReactJS Hands-on)
## Task Summaries

### 1. ReactJS Hands-on Lab: Create "myfirstreact" Application
* **Objective:** Set up a React environment using `create-react-app` and display a custom message.
* **Description:** This project demonstrates the fundamental steps of creating a new React application and modifying its initial content to show "Welcome to the first session of React" as a heading.

### 2. ReactJS Hands-on Lab: Student Management Portal - Multiple Components
* **Objective:** Create and render multiple functional components within a single React application.
* **Description:** This application, named `StudentApp`, showcases component reusability and composition. It includes `Home`, `About`, and `Contact` components, each displaying a unique welcome message, all rendered together in the main application.

### 3. ReactJS Hands-on Lab: Score Calculator Application with Functional Component and Styling
* **Objective:** Implement a functional component, pass props, perform calculations, and apply external CSS styles.
* **Description:** The `scorecalculatorapp` features a `CalculateScore` functional component that accepts student details (Name, School, Total, Goal) via props, calculates the average score, and displays it. Custom CSS from `mystyle.css` is applied to enhance its presentation.

### 4. ReactJS Hands-on Lab: Blog Application with Lifecycle Hooks and Fetch API
* **Objective:** Utilize React class component lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `componentDidCatch`) and the Fetch API to retrieve and display data.
* **Description:** This `blogapp` demonstrates fetching a list of posts from a public API (`jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`) when the component mounts. It displays post titles and bodies and includes error handling using `componentDidCatch` to alert the user of any component-level issues.

### 5. ReactJS Hands-on Lab: Styling Components with CSS Modules and Conditional Styling
* **Objective:** Apply advanced styling techniques using CSS Modules and implement conditional styling based on component data.
* **Description:** Building upon an existing cohort dashboard application, this task involves creating `CohortDetails.module.css` to define modular styles (e.g., for a `box` layout). It also demonstrates applying conditional inline styles to an `<h3>` element, making it green for "ongoing" cohorts and blue otherwise, based on the cohort's status property.
